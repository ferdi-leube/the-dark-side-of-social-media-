# Final Project - The Dark Side of Social Media - 

*Ferdinand Leube*
*[DA, Paris & 07/22]*

## Description 
#### Domain
Impacts of social media on society and on gun violence in the US

#### Main Hypothesis:
Through an early confrontation with violence and weapons on social media, children in current generation are getting used to this kind of content and are therefor less inhibited to use violent methods when facing a problem, dispute, struggling with mental illness etc.

#### To do:
- What factors might have an impact on/correlation with increase of gun violence?
- Is Hypothesis supported by data analysis results?
- How could we protect children from being confronted with such content?

This project serves the purpose of presenting my learned skills from the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp in the field of data analytics and machine learning. It can be devided in two sections. First: collecting and cleaning the data I neaded for my business case, analyzing the developments of the different factors and their dependencies regarding their impact on gun violence development in the US. Second: deciding on how children in the current generation could be prevented from viewing weapon related content, as a conclusion constructing a deep learning recognition model able to filter out pictures displaying weapons as a possible apllication for different social media platforms to fruther enhance the control parents have over the content their children are confronted with on social media.

Highlights:
- learning more about working with images
- pixel organization
- pixel shaping and rearrangement
- further understanding the importance of the correct and necessary data preparation before training machine learning models

## Plan
- Data collection
- Data cleaning and prepearation
- EDA
- Tableau visualisations
- Linear regression model
- Preparing deepp learning model to filter out content including weapons
- Data preperation/pixel arrangement and reshaping

## Meta Data
### Social Media users info
This open source data set includes the average number of monthly users for different spcial media platforms such as facebook, Twitter, etc. from the year 2008 to 2018, when information for that platform exists for the certain year. 

### Gun violence in the US
The data was collcted from the gun violence archive. It includes multiple details about different gun violence occurences in the states such as location, date, participant age and gender, number of killed individuals etc.

### Registered guns in the US
The ATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the US, collects information about the domains mentioned before on a yearly basis. I used one of their retrieved data displaying information about the number of imported and manufactured guns per year

### Federal Firearms Licensees and Compliance Inspections
I used the same source as for the previous dataset and collected the data from the ATF report. The information given here is the total number of gun licenses and the percentage of inspected gun licenses per year.

### Mental Health
The source for this dataset was: Our world in Data, giving yearly information about the percentage of patients per total population of different countries for various mental health disorders.
