final project:

- check development of:
1. gun violence

to look for connections:
2. gun ownership, numer of guns sold
3. development of social media usage
4. income level
5. cases of mental illnesses, rank of mental illness


check for other facts if possible:
- age of the people commiting gun violence


(corr heatmap)
make regression model looking for importance of each features
Hypo being:
high correlation between increase social media und gun violence

forecasts timeseries for:
1.social media users
2. gun violence

propose method to reduce thsi devlopemt:
--> create safe mode on social media platforms enabling parents
to block social media platforms from showing post including wepons

- make deep learning and/or supervised learning model for detecting 
if imag contains guns or not


lets start with real plan:

Check the final project presentation and evaluation criteria

Ksneias steps day 1:

1. Check the final project presentation and evaluation criteria
2. Create a repo for final project
3. Define business case and goal, and add this info to your slides
4. Create Trello/Jira board and share with me
5. Add project planning there and to the slide
6. Define data sources and add to readme file the info about metadata
7. Collect data
8. Clean data
9. EDA
10.add cleaned data set to github

factors decided on:
mentall illness
social media
gun ownership
gun laws
gun licenses


Hypos:

negative correlation between laws and gun violece
correlation between decreased licenses and violence
mental illness positive correlation (induced by social media)
gun ownership and lets see
positive correlation between social media and everything bad

steps:

make data cleaning data prepping
data EDA
regression model, see impact of features on model

Conclusions

make deep learning model evaluating pictures, cleaning out the ones with weapons
make a function

extra info necessary:
how to turn HTML ino pandas
how to turn pictures into pixel arrays or find mutlitple arrays to combine


Main Hypothesis:
through an early confrontation with violence and wepons on social media,
children in this generation are getting used to this kind of content and are therefor
less inhibetet to grap to such methods when facing a problem, dispute, when struggeling with mental illness etc.


do I have all data?
gun violence     yes    uploaded
gun laws     yes        uploaded
gun licenses    yes      uploaded
gun ownership   yes     uploaded
mental illness   yes      uploaded but unusable
social media    yes       uploaded
(video games)
(oher factors you want to include in analysis)



## day 2 next steps

- continue cleaning all data sets and make insights you can
- prepare them as much as possible for later visualization
- ask ksenia questions marked in lab
- ask how to do time series for past

- talk about expected relationship between variables and violence
- visualize actual relationship

(do this step now or after time series equalization)


- make time series for all to recieve data for the same number of years
- build regression model to see impact of each factor on violence

- collect pictures, random regular ones and ones with weapons

- construct deep learning model
- make function
